# Install Java 8

You will need Java 8 installed and configured on your system.  You can find it on the [Java Website](https://java.com/download/).  Make sure you've got Java 8: VocabHunter won't run on earlier versions of Java.

# Apple Mac

Download the latest release here: [VocabHunter.app.zip](https://github.com/VocabHunter/VocabHunter/releases/download/{{site.release_version}}/VocabHunter.app.zip)

Unzip the file and drag the ``VocabHunter.app`` file into your ``Applications`` folder and then you should be able to launch it like any other Mac application.

Depending on the Gatekeeper settings on your Mac you may have problems opening the application for the first time.  If you do, open the ``Applications`` folder in the Finder and right-click on the ``VocabHunter.app``.  Choose 'Open' in the menu that appears and you should then see a dialogue checking whether you really want to open the application.  Select 'Open' now and VocabHunter should start without problems.  Once you've done this once, your Mac will remember your choice and you should subsequently be able to start VocabHunter without problems.

# Linux

The latest release of VocabHunter can be downloaded as a Zip file here: [VocabHunter-{{site.release_version}}.zip](https://github.com/VocabHunter/VocabHunter/releases/download/{{site.release_version}}/VocabHunter-{{site.release_version}}.zip).

First extract the contents of the Zip file into a directory.  Then run the ``VocabHunter`` file found in the ``bin`` directory.

# Microsoft Windows

The latest release of VocabHunter can be downloaded as a Zip file here: [VocabHunter-{{site.release_version}}.zip](https://github.com/VocabHunter/VocabHunter/releases/download/{{site.release_version}}/VocabHunter-{{site.release_version}}.zip).

First extract the contents of the Zip file into a directory.  Then run the ``VocabHunter.bat`` file found in the ``bin`` directory.  Depending on your Windows version and settings you may see an error preventing you from running the program.  If you do, click the 'More Info' hyperlink and then choose the 'Run Anyway' option.

# What to Do Now
