# Acknowledgements and Thanks

Like all good Open Source projects, VocabHunter builds on the software and work of others.  This includes but is not limited to:

* The user interface of VocabHunter is built with the [JavaFX] library that now comes as standard, as part of Java 8.
* The [Apache Tika] project provides the components that make it possible to read a wide variety of document formats.
* [TestFX][TestFXProject] is used for the automated GUI test.  The detailed guide [User Interface Testing with TestFX][TestFXBlog] explains how this works.
* [ControlsFX] is used for some of the GUI components including the status bar.
* The installable bundles are created using the [javafx-gradle-plugin].
* [Font Awesome] was used for various VocabHunter icons.
