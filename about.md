* The user interface of VocabHunter is build with the [JavaFX](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javafx-overview-2158620.html) library that now comes as standard, as part of Java 8.
* The [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) project provides the components that make it possible to read a wide variety of document formats.
* [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) supports the automatic testing of the user interface of the system.
* [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) was used for various VocabHunter icons.
