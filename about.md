# Acknowledgements and Thanks

Like all good Open Source projects, VocabHunter builds on the software and work of others.  This includes but is not limited to:

* The user interface of VocabHunter is built with the [JavaFX] library that now comes as standard, as part of Java 8.
* The [Apache Tika] project provides the components that make it possible to read a wide variety of document formats.  You can learn more about this in the article [Read (Almost) Any Document in Java].
* [TestFX][TestFXProject] is used for the automated GUI test.  The detailed guide [User Interface Testing with TestFX][TestFXBlog] explains how this works.
* [ControlsFX] is used for some of the GUI components including the status bar.
* The installable bundles are created using the [javafx-gradle-plugin].
* VocabHunter uses [FontAwesomeFX] to generate various icons from the [Font Awesome] set.
* Dependency Injection is handled with [Gluon Ignite] and [Guice].  You can find out all about this in the article [Dependency Injection in JavaFX][DependencyInjection].

Finally, some acknowledgements for this website:

* Output from the [Simple Sharing Buttons Generator] was adapted for the social network sharing buttons on this site.
* The icons for the sharing buttons come from the [Social Flat Rounded Rects] set by [Aha-Soft].
