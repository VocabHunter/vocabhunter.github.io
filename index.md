VocabHunter is a system to help learners of foreign languages.  Reading is a vital skill if you want to learn a foreign language but students often feel that it would be useful to learn the most important vocab for a book before reading it.  VocabHunter enables them to do this.

The system will analyse a document and give an ordered list of the most frequently-occurring words.  The user can then quickly hunt through the vocab list, easily marking words as known or unknown to them.  To help with any doubts, the user can consult a list of the uses of the word in context, with the word itself highlighted.  See the following screenshot to get a flavour of this:

Once the user has selected the vocab that is new to them, they can then view the words in the user interface or export them to a file.  Here you can see the selected vocab being viewed directly in the user interface:

The program runs on Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X and Linux.  The system itself is a self-contained Java desktop application.  There is no server component to VocabHunter.  For download and installation instructions, see the [download](/download) page.
