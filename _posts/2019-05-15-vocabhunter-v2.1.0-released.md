# New VocabHunter Release
![VocabHunter v2.1.0](/assets/VocabHunter-Release-v2.1.0.png){: .center-image }

VocabHunter is an Open Source tool designed to help you to learn a foreign language.  v2.1.0 of VocabHunter is available now.  Get your free copy from the [download](/download) page.

The main changes in this release are:

* Following user feedback, when you export your list of words, any notes you have added will be exported alongside the words.  If you really just want the words without the notes, use the "Export Selection Without Notes" option in the "Words" menu.
* VocabHunter now runs using version 11.0.3 of Java from [AdoptOpenJDK].  This is bundled with VocabHunter so there is no need to install Java separately.
* A handful of minor bugs were fixed and the versions of the Open Source libraries used in the software were all updated.

VocabHunter v2.1.0 is available now as a free [download](/download).  The software is all Open Source so if you are technically-minded please feel free to [fork the repository on GitHub][GitHub] and experiment.
