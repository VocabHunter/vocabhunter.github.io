VocabHunter is an Open Source tool designed to help you to learn a foreign language.  v2.3.0 of VocabHunter is available now.  Get your free copy from the [download](/download) page.

The main changes in this release are:

* The installable bundle is now built with the "jpackage" tool that comes with Java 16.  All of these installable bundles are available on the [download](/download) page.  If you'd like to try out building the bundles yourself, you can find instructions [here in the project repository][PACKAGING.md].
* Thanks to a new version (v1.26) of Apache Tika, VocabHunter can now read even more document formats.  You can learn about how Apache Tika is used to read document types ranging from PDF to Microsoft Word in the article [Read (Almost) Any Document in Java].
* A handful of minor bugs were fixed and the versions of the Open Source libraries used in the software were all updated.

VocabHunter v2.3.0 is available now as a free [download](/download).  The software is all Open Source so if you are technically-minded please feel free to [fork the repository on GitHub][GitHub] and experiment.
