# New VocabHunter Release
![VocabHunter v2.2.0](/assets/VocabHunter-Release-v2.2.0.png){: .center-image }

VocabHunter is an Open Source tool designed to help you to learn a foreign language.  v2.2.0 of VocabHunter is available now.  Get your free copy from the [download](/download) page.

The main changes in this release are:

* The whole of VocabHunter has been translated into Spanish!  So if, for example, you know a Spanish speaker who is learning English but is still more comfortable in their native Spanish, share VocabHunter with them and they can switch it into their mother tongue.  You can switch between the two languages at any time.
* The main pages of the website are now available in Spanish instead of just English.  You can find the Spanish version [here](/es/).
* An option has been added to the "Words" menu to copy the current word.  This is great for quick web searches if you're not sure of the meaning of a word you are analysing.
* VocabHunter can now read even more document formats thanks to a new version (v1.23) of Apache Tika.  For more information about how Apache Tika is used to read document types ranging from PDF to Microsoft Word, see the article [Read (Almost) Any Document in Java].
* A handful of minor bugs were fixed and the versions of the Open Source libraries used in the software were all updated.

VocabHunter v2.2.0 is available now as a free [download](/download).  The software is all Open Source so if you are technically-minded please feel free to [fork the repository on GitHub][GitHub] and experiment.
