# New VocabHunter Release
![VocabHunter v2.0.0](/assets/VocabHunter-Release-v2.0.0.png){: .center-image }

VocabHunter is an Open Source tool designed to help you to learn a foreign language.  v2.0.0 of VocabHunter is available now.  Get your free copy from the [download](/download) page.

The main changes in this release are:

* VocabHunter now uses JDK 11 and OpenJFX 11.  This is a big internal change that will benefit users in various ways including bringing all the performance improvements that come with the latest technology.
* The installable bundles provided for Mac, Linux and Windows are now completely self-contained.  There is no longer any need to install Java first before using the system.  The article [Using the Java Packager with JDK 11] explains how this was achieved.
* Thanks to a new version (v1.20) of Apache Tika, VocabHunter can now read even more document formats.  For more information about how Apache Tika is used to read document types ranging from PDF to Microsoft Word, see the article [Read (Almost) Any Document in Java].
* As usual, a few other software libraries used internally by VocabHunter were updated.

VocabHunter v2.0.0 is available now as a free [download](/download).  The software is all Open Source so if you are technically-minded please feel free to [fork the repository on GitHub][GitHub] and experiment.
