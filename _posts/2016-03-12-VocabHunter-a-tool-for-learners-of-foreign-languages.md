I wrote an article about VocabHunter over at the King Tech Blog: [VocabHunter – A tool for learners of foreign languages](https://techblog.king.com/vocabhunter-a-tool-for-learners-of-foreign-languages/).

The article talks about some of the technology behind VocabHunter, highlighting Java 8 and the JavaFX user interface.
