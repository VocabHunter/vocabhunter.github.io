I've just published my article [Using the Java Packager with JDK 11] on Medium.  You can read all about how to package a JDK 11 application into a bundle that can be installed on Mac, Windows or Linux.  A worked example is given based on the Open Source [Santulator] project.

# Update: _jpackage_ is now Production-Ready

As of JDK 16, _jpackage_ is now production-ready.  I've written an updated article, [Installable Java Apps with jpackage] and I would recommend that now, rather than the orginal article.
