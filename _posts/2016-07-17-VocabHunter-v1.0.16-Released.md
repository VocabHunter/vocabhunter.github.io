I've just released a new version of VocabHunter.  You can get a copy from the [download](/download) page.  The main changes in this release are:

* The `.wordy` file format that VocabHunter uses to store sessions is now much more efficient.  Just as an example, in a novel I am studying with the system I found that simply opening and resaving the session with the new version of VocabHunter reduced the file size by a factor of ten.
* [Peter Rogge](https://github.com/Naoghuman) spotted a problem relating to opening a saved session.  The list of file types shown in the dialogue was misleading.  This has now been corrected.  Thanks Peter!
* The [ControlsFX](http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/) library was updated to v8.40.11.  Various other libraries were also updated.
