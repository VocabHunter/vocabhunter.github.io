VocabHunter is an Open Source tool designed to help you to learn a foreign language.  v1.0.21 of VocabHunter is available now.  Get your free copy from the [download](/download) page.

The main changes in this release are:

* Filter files are now loaded in the background.  Multiple filter files load in parallel.  This makes a big difference to the overall performance of the filtering system.
* Thanks to a new version (v1.15) of [Apache Tika], VocabHunter can now read even more document formats.  The new version includes an important fix to a problem where formatting information appeared as text for certain books in the ePub electronic book format.
* [How to Use VocabHunter], the user manual has been expanded and improved.  Even if you've been using VocabHunter for a while, take a look as you might learn something new about the system:
