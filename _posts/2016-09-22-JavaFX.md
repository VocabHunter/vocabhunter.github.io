Take a look at the article I wrote over on the King Tech Blog: [How JavaFX was used to build a desktop application][KingTechBlog2].

In the article I talk about how JavaFX makes it easy to build a fully-functioning modern desktop application in Java.  The article explains several important JavaFX features and provides links to the VocabHunter source code (all Open Source) so that you can see real examples of how to use these features.
