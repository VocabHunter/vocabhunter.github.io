# Analyse a Document

Press the "New" button to choose a document to analyse.  VocabHunter can read  a variety of formats including plain text, Microsoft Word and PDF documents.  After clicking on the "New" button you can select your document using a standard file dialogue.  The system will now load and analyse your document and you will see the results of the analysis in the user interface.  You should see something similar to the following:

# Save the Session

You can now save the results of the analysis.  Press the "Save" button and you will be prompted with a file dialogue so that you can choose the session name and where to put the file.  Make sure you keep saving your work as you go, hunting for new vocab using the system.  You can always reopen a saved session using the "Open" button.

# Hunt for New Vocab

Now you're ready to hunt for new vocab.  The system will show you the words, one by one, in order of their frequency within your document.  Starting with the first word, you should now press either the "Don't Know" or "Know" button according to whether this is new vocab for you or not.  At the bottom of the window you can scroll through the uses of the word in context if you need help to check whether the word really is new to you or not.

Work your way through each of the words, using the "Don't Know" and "Know" buttons to build up your list of new vocab.  Once you get used to the system, you may find that you work faster at marking up words using the keyboard.  If so, use the "x" key for "Don't Know" and "k" for "Know".

You can stop at any time if you feel that you have reached a point where you have covered all of the important words in the document.  You can also go back and revisit words you have already marked up in case you want to make corrections.

Finally, do make sure that you regularly save your session so that you don't lose any of your work.

# View the New Vocab

Once you have marked some words as being new vocab for you, you can take a look at the fruits of your labour by pressing the "Show Selection" button.  This will restrict the word list on the right-hand side of the window to show only your new vocab.  The following shows this:

At any time you can return to your hunt for new vocab by pressing the "Select Words" button.

# Export the New Vocab

In addition to viewing your new vocab in the main window, you can also write the words out to a file.  To do this, press the "Export Selection" button.  You will be prompted with a standard file dialogue in which you can give the file a name and choose where to save it.  The file is a simple text file that you can open in any standard text editing, word processing or spreadsheet software.

# Checking Your Progress

As you are working through a document, it is useful to know how many words you have marked, what remains to be done and other statistics.  You can find this information in the "Progress Report" tab:
